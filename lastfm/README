A tiny Last.FM PHP API implementation (read only methods), requires PHP5

Some explanation from a conversation related to getting festival information:

All the available API calls are listed in lines 48..150 - line 48 translates to:

$lastfm = new lastfm( $your_api_key );
$links = $lastfm->album->getBuyLinks("The Beatles", "Please Please Me");

This returns some object (see http://www.last.fm/api/show?service=429 for a hint) which is purely stdClass types (not an XML structure)

With regards to festivals, they are listed under the "events" namespace which has no search method - this means that finding the event ID is difficult.

There are various ways you could go about it:
 - have the user input the ID manually (not a great idea)
 - have the user input the Last.FM event URL (and then regex for the ID)
 - search a location using the $lastfm->geo->getEvents("san jose")
 - search a long/lat using $lasfm->geo->getEvents(null,"37.33.9592","-121.89537"); - get users to click a map using the Google Maps API for bonus points
 - if you know one (or more) of the artists, use $lastfm->artist->getEvents("At The Drive In"); and then look in the returned events for the one you want.

All of these will hopefully get you the event ID, and you can then use
$lastfm->events->getInfo(1891074);
